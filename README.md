# BSPConversionLib
C# library for converting BSP files between engine versions without decompilation. This approach has the following advantages:
- Lightmaps can be preserved across engine versions (lighting information is lost when decompiling Quake BSP's)
- Fewer steps to port maps

## Supported BSP conversions
- Quake 3 -> Source Engine **(WIP)**
- Half-Life (GoldSrc) -> Source Engine **(Not Started)**
