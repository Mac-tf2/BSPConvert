# BSPConvert
C# library for converting BSP files between engine versions without decompilation. This approach has the following advantages:
- Lightmaps can be preserved across engine versions (lighting information is lost when decompiling Quake BSP's)
- Maps can be ported in seconds with one command rather than many hours of manual effort

Check out this video for a demonstration of what this tool is currently capable of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg6_sGcCLJ4
